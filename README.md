The code in the notebooks randomly selects 500+ cities across the world. Then, the code collects data from the OpenWeatherMap API to create a representatitve model of weather across world cities. The API data is used to graph the following relationships:
    Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
    Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
    Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
    Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

From the analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn:
    There seems to be a correlation of Temperature and Latitude
    There is no strong relationship between latitude and cloudiness
    There is no strong relationship between latitude and wind speed
    There is no strong relationship between latitude and humidity
